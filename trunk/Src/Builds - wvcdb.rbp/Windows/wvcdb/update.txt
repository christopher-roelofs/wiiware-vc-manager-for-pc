=====Super Mario Bros.2_FB2J=====
added description: Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Now available on the Virtual Console in all of its original splendor, Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that’s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game’s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don’t be surprised if she’s in another castle!

=====Art Style: Rotozoa _WA8E=====
added description: Guide a rotozoan through primordial ooze where precise control and movement are vital to your success. 

Control a circular creature-like organism known as a rotozoan and nimbly make your way through level after level of primordial ooze. Comprised of only three distinct parts (colored sides, tentacles, and life force), the focus of your rotozoan life is simple: grow your tentacles. 

After playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan. Each mode has its own specific purpose: either reaching a particular length with your tentacles or growing them to the greatest length possible. Regardless of mode though, growing your tentacles means absorbing enemies, known as goobugs, by touching them. Just one catch: successfully absorbing a goobug depends on its color matching the color of your tentacle. Adding to the challenge, longer tentacles can more easily touch incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force) and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the life force-restoring heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive. 

With atmospheres ranging from peaceful calm to intensely challenging, Art Style: Rotozoa offers a wide variety of levels. Victory can only be achieved through quick, but precise, movement and the ability to remain calm under pressure. Are you ready to take on the goobugs? 

Games in the Art Style series feature elegant design, polished graphics, and pick-up-and-play controls, creating an experience focused purely on fun and engaging game play.

added description: And Yet It Moves is a puzzle-platformer set in a unique world made of ripped paper.

Within the paper-collage you can jump, run and, last but certainly not least, rotate the world. This has clear implications on the game environment: walls become floors, tunnels may suddenly be used as downward slides and a stone resting on the ground may fall, becoming either a dangerous obstacle or useful object for catapulting.

To successfully progress through a level, you must apply the physical consequences of rotating the world to the avatar and to other moving objects, like stones, drops of water and branches, as well as to living things, such as bats, monkeys and much more.

And Yet It Moves is notable for its polished, focused gameplay and unique artistic style. Each object, plant or animal that the player encounters is ripped out of a photo or movie image and brought to life using current realtime rendering techniques. Every level was designed through a meticulous handmade process, including various back- and foreground layers, making it more interesting to play through.

Take on 17 levels where you jump, run, and rotate the world in 90 degree intervals to progress.

Solve mind-bending puzzles set in an extraordinary paper collage world, with three different environments, enriched and brought to lifewith handmade sounds and music.

Go for the high score by challenging your friends and polish your skills of rotation.

Not only do players build static towers to stop the beaver-sent robot-onslaught, they also directly control one of several mobile and super-tough hero robots, the Thermidoom company’s pride and joy. Heroes can use anything from dual chain-guns to flame throwers to fortify their HQ. These moving weapons can then be upgraded as they gain experience, becoming even more powerful fighting machines.

added description: That awful King Dedede is at it again—he’s stolen all the food in Dream Land! It’s up to Kirby to get it back…and ultimately save Pop Star from being taken over. In what may be the most diverse adventure yet for the round, pink hero, he journeys through six main games and two minigames, finishing with the ultimate showdown in The Arena. Each game offers its own story and variation of platforming action, as well as unique environments and an assortment of enemies. Speaking of which, swallowing an enemy allows Kirby to copy the abilities of that enemy, granting him the power to perform special attacks and giving him a new hat to don. Adding a strategic twist, Kirby can now give up an acquired ability and use it to instead turn an enemy into a helper. The helper will follow Kirby around and automatically fight as his ally—or offer a second player the chance to join in the game by controlling it. There’s never a dull moment as Kirby dashes, flies, and swallows enemies in his battle against King Dedede, Dyna Blade, Meta Knight, and more!

added description: Join the epic battle as good and evil battle for a young warrior's heart!

There is one force in the universe that keeps good and evil in perfect balance. It is called the Mana Tree. But a magic sword has called to a young warrior to draw it, which upsets this balance and spreads evil throughout the land. Thus, the warrior must undertake a dangerous journey to find the Seeds of Mana, which have been hidden for centuries. Only then can perfect harmony be restored.

In this incredible adventure, things are never as they seem! Magic swords release evil as well as fight it. Treasure chests hold booby traps. Monsters are friends - and friends are enemies. Potions give power, black magic takes it away. Dragons fly, weapons change.

It's a world turned upside down that you must help the warrior make right again. And the only way to succeed is to solve the Secret of Mana.

Slash) this situation has become personal. Especially after three friends from their martial arts gym get abducted.

The duo set off to the enemy's secret Air Fortress to sort things out. These guys know all the moves, from martial arts to pro wrestling throws - and they don't hesitate to use them. They’re not afraid of using whatever it takes to get the job done. And if that wasn’t enough, when they get hurt they get angry – and you really don’t want to mess with them then. They ignore damage and hit even harder than usual! They’re ready for the action - the question is... are you?

Players face the Zeograd invasion force with weapon attacks that change each time they grab a power-up item. Players can unleash three different kinds of attack depending on the color of the power-up item. New features, such as the "Gunbody" option for avoiding enemy attacks and the "Burst Out" system (which has a different effect depending on the power-up level), add a strategic element that requires players to make snap decisions about which items to grab and when to use special attacks. Awesome boss battles await players at the end of each operation. Playing in "CHALLENGE" mode requires players to try to get as many points as they can in a limited amount of time.

Additionally, if players charge up their gauges, they’ll be able to make an earth-shattering super shot that can break any defense. This game successfully combines adherence to the basics of basketball with some outrageous special moves.

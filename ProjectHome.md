`WiiWare`-VC Manager lets you easily manage the `WiiWare` and VC .wad files on your SD card or HD.

  * Remove wads from destination
  * Get info about wads on source or destination
  * Add wads from source to destination

# Details #


`WiiWare`-VC Manager uses the naming convention ` {channeltitle}_{titleid}.wad ` to lookup info about the game. If the name is not in this format you can still move the file from source to destination, you just won't get any info or pretty picture

To get your wad files in the correct format use the excellent program [Showmiiwads](http://code.google.com/p/showmiiwads/downloads/list) or the more up to date [Showmiiwads-mod](http://code.google.com/p/showmiiwads-mod/downloads/list)

Many of the Cover Art images and much of the game data is pulled from [GameTBD](http://www.gametdb.com/)
